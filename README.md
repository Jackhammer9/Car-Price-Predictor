Overview
--------
Predicting the price of used cars is a valuable exercise for both car dealerships
and individual car owners. By analyzing historical data, we can use machine
learning techniques to estimate the market value of a used car based on features
like make, model, mileage, engine capacity, fuel type, and more.

This project showcases:
- End-to-end data handling (cleaning, feature engineering)
- Multiple regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model tuning and evaluation

Goal:
Create a predictive model that accurately estimates a car’s price given its
attributes.

Dataset
-------
Source: Car Price Prediction Dataset by Hellbuoy on Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction)

This dataset contains various features like:
- Car name (brand/model)
- Year of manufacture
- Selling price
- Present price (original price)
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type, Seller type, Transmission
- And more…

Note: Please check the dataset’s licensing and usage permissions before
commercial use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started
---------------
1. Clone the Repository

   git clone https://github.com/Jackhammer9/Car-Price-Predictor.git
   cd Car-Price-Predictor

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

   # Using conda
   conda create -n car-price-predictor python=3.8
   conda activate car-price-predictor

   # or using venv
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies

   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download the Dataset
   If not included, download the dataset from Kaggle:
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction
   and place it in the data/ folder (e.g., Car-Data.csv).

5. Run the Notebooks
   jupyter notebook
   Open notebooks/01-EDA.ipynb to explore data, then 02-Model-Building.ipynb
   for model training and evaluation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
-------------------------------
During EDA, we examine:
- Missing values and possible imputation strategies
- Distribution of numeric variables (mileage, price, etc.)
- Categorical variable analysis (fuel type, seller type, etc.)
- Correlation between features and target (selling price)

Example findings:
- Year and Present Price show strong correlations with Selling Price.
- Fuel Type influences price, with Diesel cars being priced differently than
  Petrol or CNG cars.

(See 01-EDA.ipynb for all the details and visualizations.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modeling Approach
-----------------
We tried multiple algorithms to find the best performer:

1. Linear Regression
   - Pros: Interpretable, fast to train
   - Cons: May not capture nonlinear relationships well

2. Random Forest
   - Pros: Handles nonlinearities, robust to outliers, can measure feature importance
   - Cons: Can be slower, may overfit if not tuned properly

3. XGBoost
   - Pros: Often achieves high accuracy on tabular data, can handle missing data well
   - Cons: Tuning can be more involved

Hyperparameter Tuning:
We used GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for each model to find optimal
parameters (e.g., max depth, n_estimators, learning rate).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Results
-------
| Model            | MAE       | MSE       | R^2 Score |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| LinearReg        | 1.23 L    | 3.20 L    | 0.80      |
| RandomForest     | 0.98 L    | 2.45 L    | 0.88      |
| XGBoost          | 0.95 L    | 2.30 L    | 0.90      |

Note: The values above are placeholders—replace with your actual results.

Best Model: XGBoost with an R^2 score of ~0.90 on the test set.

Key Insights:
- Present Price and Year are highly influential.
- Fuel Type and Transmission also significantly impact predictions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Use
----------
1. Training a New Model
   - Update hyperparameters in src/train.py or the relevant notebook.
   - Run the notebook or:
     python src/train.py
   - Generates a new model file in the models/ folder.

2. Predicting Car Prices
   - Use the existing trained model (final_model.pkl):

     import pickle
     import numpy as np

     with open("models/final_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
         model = pickle.load(f)

     # Example input: [Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, ...]
     sample = np.array([[10.0, 40000, 1, 1, 2015]])  # shape: (1, n_features)
     pred_price = model.predict(sample)
     print("Predicted Price:", pred_price[0])

3. (Optional) Streamlit/Gradio App
   - Create a simple web UI to allow user input and real-time predictions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future Improvements
-------------------
1. Advanced Feature Engineering:
   - Derived features like car age, brand-specific average prices, etc.

2. Ensemble Methods:
   - Combine multiple models (e.g., stacking) for improved performance.

3. Deep Learning:
   - Experiment with neural networks on tabular data (though benefits may vary).

4. Deployment:
   - Containerize with Docker or deploy to AWS/Azure/GCP.
